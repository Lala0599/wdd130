            <p>Hello! My name is Laone P Tsheole, but everyone calls me Lala. I am from Botswana, located in the Southern part of Africa. By day I find patterns in data,and transform numbers into insights; at night you'll find me in the kitchen covered in flour with occassional chocolate on my apron. When I am not doing that, you'll find doing audits and writing reports at church. I growing my web development skills because I have always neglected them, looking forward to connecting and learning.</p>
